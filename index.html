            Brighton Beach, on the south coast of England, is a shingle beach
            that has been nourished with very large pebbles in an effort to
            withstand the erosion of the upper area of the beach. These large
            pebbles made the beach unwelcoming for pedestrians for a period of
            time until natural processes integrated the naturally occurring
            shingle into the pebble base.
